% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

%We have used longslit spectroscopy observations obtained with the William Herschel Telescope with the aim of characterizing the turbulent state of the ionized gas in giant HII regions.
%For this purpose, the \halpha, \n, \oi\ and \s\ emission lines were investigated applying a statistical analysis on their velocities samples. 
%The correlations in our results are evidence that the velocity field can be consider as homogeneous turbulence, a statistically stationary process. This turbulent motions can be described by a power law with a mean index of 0.60$\pm$0.02 and a physical coherent scale up to $\sim$60 pc for NGC 604 and 1.04$\pm$0.01 with a correlation length up to $\sim$60 pc for NGC 595. 
%The physical interpretation of our results consider that an energy cascade is taking place for all the ionic species.
%Finally, we give our explanation for our results and fit them in the context of turbulence in giant HII regions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

There is evidence that different phases of the interstellar medium exhibits a chaotic behavior \citep{franco1999interstellar,elmegreen2004interstellar,scalo2004interstellar}. Velocity fields shows complex motions in the plane-of-sky (POS) and a non-thermal broadening on their spectral lines, suggests disorder motions along the line-of-sight (LOS). The large lengths of astrophysical objects, ranging in scales from 10$^{6}$ to 10$^{17}$ m \citep{chepurnov2010extending}, is closely related to the existence of turbulent flows. The high Reynolds numbers (Re), in the order of 10$^{4}$ and 10$^{9}$, present in these objects \citep{lagrois2011} is taken as first approach to understand the relationship between turbulence and the observed movements. Despite numerous attempts in characterizing the turbulence in the photoionized gas, little understood on how the results indicate something about the physics of the object.   

The mathematical techniques developed by \citet{kolm1,heisenberg1951stability} were first applied to astronomical observations by \citet{von1951methode} and \citet{munch1958internal}. Their aim was to investigate the projection of a three-dimensional function into the plane of the sky. This procedure using the structure function allowed to determine a distinction between homogeneous turbulence and pure random velocity fluctuations, in this case in the galactic HII region, the Orion Nebula. The analysis on the turbulence of the Orion Nebula was continued by \citet{castaneda1987} and \citet{1992ApJ...387..229O}. In more recent years \cite{medina2014} and \cite{arthur2016turbulence} used another statistical technique called velocity channel analysis (VCA) \citep{2000ApJ...537..720L}, along the structure function, to study the Orion nebula. Recently, the structure function was used with full 6D measurements (position-velocity) to study the motions of stars in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. \cite{2021ApJ...907L..40H} argue that newborn stars should reflect the turbulent kinematics of their natal clouds. Using this previous method they are free of the projected element that interfere with previous gas-based studies and their results agree with the scaling law proposed by \cite{1981MNRAS.194..809L}.  

The first attempt at characterizing turbulence in a giant extragalactic HII region (GEHR) was done by \citet{1961MNRAS.122....1F} with the 30 Dor complex in the LMC, finding no indication of turbulent motions. \cite{2019arXiv191203543M} investigated the structure function in 30 Dor finding on their results that the structure function is entirely flat on scales from 3 to 200 pc. Also, \cite{2019arXiv191203543M} studied the motions in NGC 604, previously analyzed by \cite{tanco1997}. Both results shows that there is a two slope behavior for the structure function. The structure function in the GEHR NGC 595 was first obtained by \cite{lagrois2009multi} and the analysis was expanded by \cite{lagrois2011}. In all previous studies the Kolmogorov law does not apply to any result.

GEHRs are ideal objects for the study of turbulence in the interstellar medium. These objects have large dimensions ($ \geq $100 pc) and high luminosity ($10^{38}<$ L$_{H\alpha}<10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$). There is a strong interaction between the stars clusters ($\geq$100 stars with T$_{eff}\geq30,000\ $K) and the surrounding medium (n$_{e}$=1-10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and T$_{e}$=10,000 K) via the injection of mechanical energy and the momentum given to the ionized gas \citep{castaneda1992density}. This energy and momentum comes in the form of stellar winds (v$_{w}\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$) of the O ($\dot{M}$=$10^{-5} M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$) and B ($\dot{M}$=$10^{-6.5} M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$) stars \citep{dyson1979}.

\citet{smith1970} discovered that the line width of GEHRs was supersonic, of the order of $\sigma \sim$ 17-26 km s\kms. \citet{melnick1977,terlevich1981} have shown an empirical relationship between the line width and the integrated properties of the HII regions as the diameter or the luminosity ($R \sim \sigma ^{\sim 2}$ ; $L \sim \sigma ^{\sim 4}$). They conclude that GEHR  follow this relations as self-gravity systems like globular clusters or elliptical galaxies. The idea of a virial system has been developed by \citet{1993ApJ...418..767T,munoz1996} into the \textit{Cometary Stirring Model} (CSM) with the aim to separate the mechanism that contribute to the line broadening. The stellar winds also tend to be used for an explanation of the line broadening and turbulence in GEHRs \citep{1994ApJ...425..720C}. This features seems to drive visually the regions with filaments, arcs and shells. On their spectra double and multiple emission features are signature of these objects. \cite{2020MNRAS.494...97S} argue that winds on ionizing clusters in GEHR must merge into a hot cluster because of the close proximity of the massive stars. \cite{2019ApJ...871...17U} propose that stellar feedback is an important source of energy to maintain turbulence in nearby galaxies.

Our objective is to characterize the turbulent regime for different ions in different GEHRs.  We compare our results with previous investigations.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:met}

\subsection{Observations}\label{sec:obs}

The archival data used in this work was obtained with the ISIS spectrograph and the TAURUS-II Fabry Perot in the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) of del Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (ORM) in La Palma, Spain and was retrieved from the La Palma archive\footnote{\url{http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/casuadc/ingarch}}.

\citet{2000PASP..112.1138M} and \citep{maiz2004} provides details of the observational setup for the the ISIS instrument. In summary, the spectra were obtained (1998 18-19 August) using a position angle of 90$^{\circ}$ and the slit width was 1". Two different spectra were taken simultaneously for each position: one for the red arm, between 6390 and 6849 \r{A} and another on the blue arm between 4665 and 5065 \r{A}. The slit had a length of 200" and ten  positions  were observe with an exposure time ranging from 900 to 1200 s for every slit. The  data we used was reduced again by \citet{jen2013} using the IRAF \citep{1999ascl.soft11002N} astronomical software. The ISIS observations were used by \citet{TT2000} and \citet{maiz2004}.  

For the TAURUS-II instrument, \cite{sabalisck1995supersonic} mentioned the main aspects of the observations (1990 July 31). The two-dimensional imaging spectroscopy was captured using an IPCS-II detector and the 125 $\mu$m etalon. The cumulative integration time per frame is 36 s with a seeing value of 1''. The format of the data cube was of 256*256*100 with a spatial scale of 0.26 pixel$^{-1}$. Finally, the reduction and analysis was done with the packages TAUCAL y TAUFITS \citep{1992ASPC...25..445L}.
The TAURUS-II observations were used by \cite{sabalisck1995supersonic}, \cite{tanco1997} and \cite{2019arXiv191203543M}.

\subsection{Data}

Figure \ref{fig:M604} shows the two-dimensional radial velocity map of NGC 604 in H$\alpha$. ISIS observations have been limited with the aim to match the zone cover by TAURUS instrument. The velocity scale on both instruments reflects the radial velocity in the reference frame of the region taking as a  reference point the most luminous pixel. This pixels has a value of -253.11 km/s. Figure \ref{fig:M595} shows the two-dimensional radial velocity map of NGC 595 in H$\alpha$.

\section{Turbulence}\label{sec:turb}

The classic turbulence theory \citep{kolm1} assumes a three-dimensional isotropic, incompressible and subsonic flow, where an energy cascade is taking place. The energy cascades goes downward, from the largest vortices until it reaches dissipation with the smallest vortices. 
In this energy cascade three scales can be defined: the energy injection scale (Re $\rightarrow \infty$), $L_{EI}$, the dissipation scale (Re $\rightarrow$ 1), $L_{D}$ and the inertial scale ($L_{I}$) between the previous two. The energy cascade concept is described with an energy spectrum, $E(k) \propto k^{-\beta}$ where $k$ is the wave number for a scale $l$ ($k \equiv l^{-1}$).

If we consider the mean specific energy transfer, $\langle \epsilon \rangle$, the inertial range can be denoted as $\epsilon \sim \frac{v_{l}^{2}}{\tau_{l}}$, where $v_{l}^{2}$ is the kinetic energy per mass unit and $\tau_{l}$ the time related with velocity fluctuations. Since the total specific energy of a determined $l$ scale is of the order $\langle v_{l}^{2} \rangle$ and is the energy integral above the associated $k$, defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:veles}
 \langle v_{l}^{2} \rangle = \int_{k}^{\infty} E(k)dk
\end{equation}

Considering that this energy is of the order of $(\epsilon l)^{\frac{2}{3}} \sim (\frac{\epsilon}{k})^{\frac{2}{3}}$ we can substitute in equation \ref{eq:veles} and obtain the Kolmogorov law:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:kolm}
E(k) \propto \epsilon^\frac{2}{3} k^{-\frac{5}{3}}
\end{equation}

We use the second order structure function, $S_{2}(l)$, defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
S_{2}(\boldsymbol{l})=\dfrac{\sum[V_{r}(\boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{l})-V_{r}(\boldsymbol{x}) ]^{2}}{N(\boldsymbol{l})}
\end{equation}

as a statistical tool to investigate the relation between a velocity field and the presence of turbulent motions following the Kolmogorov theory. In equation \ref{eq:S}, $V_{r}(\boldsymbol{x})= V_{obs}(\boldsymbol{x})-\langle V_{obs}(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle$ and N($\boldsymbol{l}$) the number of points at each separation. If we consider the quadratic velocities differences proportional to the left term in equation \ref{eq:kolm}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sfi}
(\Delta v)^{2} \sim (\epsilon l)^{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{equation}

the term $(\Delta v)^{2}$ can be identified as the structure function. The right term with index,  m=2/3, in equation \ref{eq:sfi} is related to the energy (the left term in equation \ref{eq:veles}). This index m serves as a reference for comparison between theory and observations.

For our fit we use the normalized structure function of the form $s(l)=2[1-C(l)]$ where $C(l)=1/[1+(l/l_{0})^{m_{2D}}]$. The term l$_{0}$ is the correlation length of the turbulence and $m_{2D}$ is the index that adjust our results \citep{1984ApJ...277..556S, arthur2016turbulence}.

\section{Results}\label{sec:res}

\subsection{NGC 604}

Figure \ref{fig:SF604} shows the structure function (Equation \ref{eq:S}) of NGC 604 for the H$\alpha$ emission line for the ISIS and TAURUS instruments. The $m_{2D}$ is 1.7 with a correlation length of 11 pc. The $\sigma$ for the ISIS instrument is 8.4 km/s and for TAURUS instrument 7.3 km/s. The fit to the power-law of the structure function is performed over the scales of 4 to 11 pc. The structure functions keep going up to scales of 70 pc, above these value the structure function falls steeply for the ISIS. As \cite{arthur2016turbulence} mentioned, the more pronounced steeping for small scales, below 4 pc in our case, is due to the spatial resolution of the observations. In comparison with TAURUS, ISIS values are higher but are able to maintain the form of the structure function. 

\subsection{NGC 595}

Figure \ref{fig:SF595} shows the structure function of NGC 595 for the H$\alpha$ emission line for the TAURUS instruments. The $m_{2D}$ is 1.7 with a correlation length of 11 pc. The $\sigma$ is 6.6 km/s. In this case it is possible to fit values under 4 pc, but this small scale region is affected due to the seeing. The range of scale for this regions stays between 10 and 11 pc as in NGC 604. The values of the structure function rise until 30 pc. Scales larger than this shows a random around 2$\sigma$.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{Comparison with previous structure functions determinations}

In an idealized case, at scales larger than r$_{0}$ the structure function flattens as it tends towards the asymptotic value of 2$\sigma$ \citep{arthur2016turbulence}. Figure \ref{fig:SF604} shows that the structure functions, except for \cite{2019arXiv191203543M}, follow a periodic behavior around 2$\sigma$. Using as reference the TAURUS results, the wave starts at 35 pc with a series of $ >$2$\sigma$ values up to $\sim$100 pc. Then $<$2$\sigma$ values follow until the largest scales of 150 pc. Therefore this periodic behavior is related to scales of 100 pc across our sample box.

Figure \ref{fig:SF604} shows similarity in the TAURUS results and previous works \citep{tanco1997,2019arXiv191203543M}. The agreement lies that observations are the same but the procedure of calculating the structure function is different. \citep{2019arXiv191203543M} has $\sigma$ of 7.2 while we have 7.3 km/s. We note that our structure function results are more similar to \cite{2019arXiv191203543M} but the periodic behavior is strongly reduced on their results; \citep{tanco1997} also show this periodic pattern at large scales.

Figure \ref{fig:SF595} shows how there is no correspondence between our results and previous investigations. Our observations cover the brightest part of the region and have smaller resolution. \citet{lagrois2011} structure function results does not cover scales $<$10 pc.
