                  properties of integrated emission and velocity
                  centroids for a slightly compressible turbulent slab
                  model, to retrieve the underlying statistics of
                  three-dimensional density and velocity
                  fluctuations. Under the assumptions that the density
                  and velocity fields are homogeneous and isotropic,
                  we derive the expressions of the antenna temperature
                  for an optically thin spectral line observation, and
                  of its successive moments with respect to the line
                  of sight velocity component, focusing on the zeroth
                  (intensity or integrated emission I) and first
                  (non-normalized velocity centroid C) moments. The
                  ratio of the latter to the former is the normalized
                  centroid C0, whose expression can be linearized for
                  small density fluctuations. To describe the
                  statistics of I, C and C0, we derive expansions of
                  their autocorrelation functions in powers of density
                  fluctuations and perform a lowest-order real-space
                  calculation of their scaling behaviour, assuming
                  that the density and velocity fields are fractional
                  Brownian motions. We hence confirm, within the scope
                  of this study, the property recently found
                  numerically by \citet{mamd2003} that the spectral
                  index of the normalized centroid is equal to that of
                  the full velocity field. However, it is also argued
                  that, in order to retrieve the velocity statistics,
                  normalization of centroids may actually not be the
                  best way to remove the influence of density
                  fluctuations. In this respect, we discuss the
                  modified velocity centroids introduced by
                  \citet{lazarian2003} as a possible alternative. In a

  abstract =	 {Calibrated Hα CCD images of 145 H II regions in the
                  Local Group galaxy NGC 6822 are used to obtain an
                  absolute Hα luminosity function and several versions
                  of diameter distributions. The luminosity function
                  reaches from the most luminous H II region, which
                  has an Hα flux of 4 x 10^38^ ergs sec^-1^, to the
                  faintest limit yet obtained for an extragalactic H
                  II region population, at a level of 5 x 10^34^ ergs
                  sec^-1^. We are thus exploring here a portion of the
                  H II region luminosity realm that has hitherto been
                  largely unsampled, except in the solar
                  neighborhood. Most of the H II regions are
                  sufficiently faint to be explained by the excitation
                  of a single early-type star, though some of the
                  faintest are probably segments of diffuse galactic
                  emission. Although the bright end of the luminosity
                  function can be fit satisfactorily to a power law,
                  as found for most spiral galaxies, the curve has a
                  peak at a flux of approximately 10^36^ ergs sec^-1^,
                  with a shallow decrease in number for fainter H II
                  regions. This behavior results from the fact that
                  the amount of ultraviolet energy released decreases
                  more steeply than the number of stars increases for
                  later-type stars. Three different definitions of
                  sizes are used to explore the properties of the H II
                  region size distribution. As found for other
                  galaxies, the size distribution can be fit by an
                  exponential; the size scale is 33 pc. The fluxes are
                  correlated to the 2.8 power of the diameter, but

                  properties of the SMC SNRs and compare them to those
                  of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) population. <BR
                  /> Methods: This study combines the large dataset of
                  XMM-Newton observations of the SMC, archival and
                  recent radio continuum observations, an optical line
                  emission survey, and new optical spectroscopic
                  observations. We were therefore able to build a
                  complete and clean sample of 19 confirmed and four
                  candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral
                  analysis allowed us to search for SN ejecta and Fe K
                  line emission, and to measure interstellar medium
                  abundances. We estimated the ratio of core-collapse
                  to type Ia supernova rates of the SMC based on the
                  X-ray properties and the local stellar environment
                  of each SNR. <BR /> Results: After the removal of
                  unconfirmed or misclassified objects, and the
                  addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on
                  multi-wavelength features, we present a final list
                  of 21 confirmed SNRs and two candidates. While no Fe
                  K line is detected even for the brightest and
                  youngest SNR, we find X-ray evidence of SN ejecta in
                  11 SNRs. We estimate a fraction of 0.62-0.92
                  core-collapse supernova for every supernova (90%
                  confidence interval), higher than in the LMC. The
                  difference can be ascribed to the absence of the
                  enhanced star-formation episode in the SMC, which
                  occurred in the LMC 0.5-1.5 Gyr ago. The hot-gas
                  abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times
                  solar. Their ratios, with respect to SMC stellar
                  abundances, reflect the effects of dust depletion
                  and partial dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find
                  evidence that the ambient medium probed by SMC SNRs
                  is less disturbed and less dense on average than in
                  the LMC, consistent with the different morphologies
                  of the two galaxies.},

                  formation of star clusters and their subsequent
                  dynamical evolution, rotation remains a largely
                  unexplored characteristic of young star clusters
                  (few Myr). Using multi-epoch spectroscopic data of
                  the inner regions of 30 Doradus in the Large
                  Magellanic Cloud obtained as part of the VLT-FLAMES
                  Tarantula Survey, we search for rotation of the
                  young massive cluster R136. From the radial
                  velocities of 36 apparently single O-type stars
                  within a projected radius of 10 pc from the centre
                  of the cluster, we find evidence, at the 95%
                  confidence level, for rotation of the cluster as a
                  whole. We use a maximum likelihood method to fit
                  simple rotation curves to our data and find a
                  typical rotational velocity of ~3 km
                  s<SUP>-1</SUP>. When compared to the low velocity
                  dispersion of R136, our result suggests that star
                  clusters may form with at least ~20% of the kinetic
                  energy in rotation. <P />Based on observations

@article{Tiwari:2020a,
  abstract =	 {Context. Messier 8 (M8), one of the brightest H II
                  regions in our Galaxy, is powered by massive O-type
                  stars and is associated with recent and ongoing
                  massive star formation. Two prominent massive
                  star-forming regions associated with M8 are M8-Main,
                  the particularly bright part of the large-scale H II
                  region (mainly) ionized by the stellar system
                  Herschel 36 (Her 36) and M8 East (M8 E), which is
                  mainly powered by a deeply embedded young stellar
                  object (YSO), the bright infrared (IR) source
                  M8E-IR. <BR /> Aims: We study the interaction of the
                  massive star-forming region M8 E with its
                  surroundings using observations of assorted diffuse
                  and dense gas tracers that allow quantifying the
                  kinetic temperatures and volume densities in this
                  region. With a multiwavelength view of M8 E, we
                  investigate the cause of star formation. Moreover,
                  we compare the star-forming environments of M8-Main
                  and M8 E, based on their physical conditions and the
                  abundances of the various observed species toward
                  them. <BR /> Methods: We used the Institut de
                  Radioastronomía Millimétrica 30 m telescope to
                  perform an imaging spectroscopy survey of the ~1 pc
                  scale molecular environment of M8E-IR and also
                  performed deep integrations toward the source
                  itself. We imaged and analyzed data for the J = 1 →
                  0 rotational transitions of <SUP>12</SUP>CO,
                  <SUP>13</SUP>CO, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN,
                  H<SUP>13</SUP>CN, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>,
                  H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, HNC, and
                  HN<SUP>13</SUP>C observed for the first time toward
                  M8 E. To visualize the distribution of the dense and
                  diffuse gas in M8 E, we compared our
                  velocity-integrated intensity maps of
                  <SUP>12</SUP>CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and
                  N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> with ancillary data taken
                  at IR and submillimeter wavelengths. We used
                  techniques that assume local thermodynamic
                  equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE to determine column
                  densities of the observed species and constrain the
                  physical conditions of the gas that causes their
                  emission. Examining the class 0/ I and class II YSO
                  populations in M8 E, allows us to explore the
                  observed ionization front (IF) as seen in the high
                  resolution Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey
                  Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) 8 μm emission image. The
                  difference between the ages of the YSOs and their
                  distribution in M8 E were used to estimate the speed
                  of the IF. <BR /> Results: We find that
                  <SUP>12</SUP>CO probes the warm diffuse gas also
                  traced by the GLIMPSE 8 μm emission, while
                  N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> traces the cool and dense
                  gas following the emission distribution of the APEX
                  Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy 870 μm
                  dust continuum. We find that the star-formation in
                  M8 E appears to be triggered by the earlier formed
                  stellar cluster NGC 6530, which powers an H II
                  region giving rise to an IF that is moving at a
                  speed ≥0.26 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> across M8 E. Based on
                  our qualitative and quantitative analysis, the J = 1
                  → 0 transition lines of N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>
                  and HN<SUP>13</SUP>C appear to be more direct
                  tracers of dense molecular gas than the J = 1 → 0
                  transition lines of HCN and HCO<SUP>+</SUP>. We
                  derive temperatures of 80 and 30 K for the warm and
                  cool gas components, respectively, and constrain the
                  H<SUB>2</SUB> volume densities to be in the range of
                  10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP>
                  cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Comparison of the observed
                  abundances of various species reflects the fact that
                  M8 E is at an earlier stage of massive star
                  formation than M8-Main.},

  abstract =	 {<BR /> Aims: Messier 8 (M8) is one of the brightest
                  HII regions in the sky. We collected an extensive
                  dataset comprising multiple sub- millimeter spectral
                  lines from neutral and ionized carbon and from
                  CO. Based on this dataset, we aim to understand the
                  morphology of M8 and that of its associated
                  photodissociation region (PDR) and to carry out a
                  quantitative analysis of the physical conditions of
                  these regions such as kinetic temperatures and
                  volume densities. <BR /> Methods: We used the
                  Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy
                  (SOFIA), the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12
                  m, and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique
                  (IRAM) 30 m telescopes to perform a comprehensive
                  imaging survey of the emission from the fine
                  structure lines of [C II] and [C I] and multiple
                  rotational transitions of carbon monoxide (CO)
                  isotopologs within 1.3 × 1.3 pc around the dominant
                  Herschel 36 (Her 36) system, which is composed of at
                  least three massive stars. To further explore the
                  morphology of the region, we compared archival
                  infrared, optical, and radio images of the nebula
                  with our newly obtained fine structure line and CO
                  data, and in particular with the velocity
                  information these data provide. We performed a
                  quantitative analysis, using both LTE and non-LTE
                  methods to determine the abundances of some of the
                  observed species, kinetic temperatures, and volume
                  densities. <BR /> Results: Bright CO, [C II] and [C
                  I] emission have been found toward the HII region
                  and the PDR in M8. Our analysis places the bulk of
                  the molecular material in the background of the
                  nebulosity illuminated by the bright stellar systems
                  Her 36 and 9 Sagitarii. Since the emission from all
                  observed atomic and molecular tracers peaks at or
                  close to the position of Her 36, we conclude that
                  the star is still physically close to its natal
                  dense cloud core and heats it. A veil of warm gas
                  moves away from Her 36 toward the Sun and its
                  associated dust contributes to the foreground
                  extinction in the region. One of the most prominent
                  star forming regions in M8, the Hourglass Nebula, is
                  particularly bright due to cracks in this veil close
                  to Her 36. We obtain H2 densities ranging from
                  10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and
                  kinetic temperatures of 100-150 K in the bright PDR
                  caused by Her 36 using radiative transfer modeling
                  of various transitions of CO isotopologs. <P />The

  abstract =	 {We present a new method to analyze the structure of
                  observed molecular cloud images which is the
                  generalization of the Allan-variance method
                  traditionally used in the stability and drift
                  analysis of instrumentation and electronic
                  devices. Applied to integrated intensity maps of two
                  molecular cloud data sets, the method shows,
                  together with an analysis of the phases of the cloud
                  images, the observed structures to be well
                  characterized by what is called a fractional
                  Brownian motion (fBm)-structure in the context of
                  fractal images. An fBm-structure results from a
                  power law power spectrum of the image and a
                  completely random distribution of the image
                  phases. The power law index beta of the power
                  spectrum derived for two sample clouds turns out to
                  be close to 2.8. For an fBm-structure, the power
                  spectral index beta determines other fractal
                  measures such as the traditionally used box-counting
                  dimension and the fractal dimension describing
                  iso-intensity contours via their area-perimeter
                  relation. We use a large data set covering
                  observations at both large and small angular scales
                  available for the Polaris Flare (Heithausen et
                  al. \cite heithausen1998 ) as the sample cloud to
                  test these concepts. The area-perimeter dimension
                  independently measured for this cloud %, d=1.6, is
                  consistent with beta =2.8. The fBm-concept allows
                  easy generation of realistic density representations
                  for model clouds, to be used in radiative transfer
                  and other cloud simulations. In a second step, we
                  show that an ensemble of randomly positioned clumps
                  with a power law mass spectrum dN/dM ~ M(-alpha )
                  gives an fBm-image. The power spectral index beta ,
                  the mass spectral index alpha , and the power law
                  index of the mass-size relation M ~ L(gamma ) turn
                  out to be related: beta =gamma (3-alpha ). The value
                  of gamma derived via this relation and the
                  independently determined values for alpha and beta
                  is consistent with the value directly determined for
                  the sample cloud. Our analysis confirms the recent
                  suggestion by Elmegreen &amp; Falgarone (\cite
                  elmegreen1996 ) that the mass distribution in
                  molecular clouds is closely connected with their
                  fractal structure, although the detailed form of the
                  relation depends on the fractal structure model
                  used. We discuss the implications of these results,
                  obtained for the 2-dimensional observed images, for
                  the underlying 3-dimensional cloud density
                  structure. With some extrapolating assumptions on
                  the 3-dim structure, they imply that the
                  3-dimensional structure is very much broken up, with
                  the surface growing proportional to the
                  volume. Clearly, additional information on the
                  velocity structure, and in particular its physical
                  link to the assumed fBm-density structure, is needed
                  to describe the relevant properties of molecular
                  cloud line shapes and line radiative transfer. The
                  fBm-structure model allows an estimate on the
                  observability of molecular cloud structure down to
                  much smaller angular scales than presently
                  reachable, e.g. with interferometric
                  observations. It turns out that, due to the
                  steepness of the image power spectrum, these will be
                  extremely difficult. Only the next generation large
                  mm-wave array will bring such observations into the
                  regime of the feasible.},

@article{Federrath:2010z,
  abstract =	 {Context. Density and velocity fluctuations on
                  virtually all scales observed with modern telescopes
                  show that molecular clouds (MCs) are turbulent. The
                  forcing and structural characteristics of this
                  turbulence are, however, still poorly
                  understood. <BR /> Aims: To shed light on this
                  subject, we study two limiting cases of turbulence
                  forcing in numerical experiments: solenoidal
                  (divergence-free) forcing and compressive
                  (curl-free) forcing, and compare our results to
                  observations. <BR /> Methods: We solve the equations
                  of hydrodynamics on grids with up to
                  1024<SUP>3</SUP> cells for purely solenoidal and
                  purely compressive forcing. Eleven lower-resolution
                  models with different forcing mixtures are also
                  analysed. <BR /> Results: Using Fourier spectra and
                  Δ-variance, we find velocity dispersion-size
                  relations consistent with observations and
                  independent numerical simulations, irrespective of
                  the type of forcing. However, compressive forcing
                  yields stronger compression at the same rms Mach
                  number than solenoidal forcing, resulting in a three
                  times larger standard deviation of volumetric and
                  column density probability distributions (PDFs). We
                  compare our results to different characterisations
                  of several observed regions, and find evidence of
                  different forcing functions. Column density PDFs in
                  the <ASTROBJ>Perseus MC</ASTROBJ> suggest the
                  presence of a mainly compressive forcing agent
                  within a shell, driven by a massive star. Although
                  the PDFs are close to log-normal, they have
                  non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis caused by
                  intermittency. Centroid velocity increments measured
                  in the <ASTROBJ>Polaris Flare</ASTROBJ> on
                  intermediate scales agree with solenoidal forcing on
                  that scale. However, Δ-variance analysis of the
                  column density in the <ASTROBJ>Polaris
                  Flare</ASTROBJ> suggests that turbulence is driven
                  on large scales, with a significant compressive
                  component on the forcing scale. This indicates that,
                  although likely driven with mostly compressive modes
                  on large scales, turbulence can behave like
                  solenoidal turbulence on smaller scales. Principal
                  component analysis of <ASTROBJ>G216-2.5</ASTROBJ>
                  and most of the <ASTROBJ>Rosette MC</ASTROBJ> agree
                  with solenoidal forcing, but the interior of an
                  ionised shell within the <ASTROBJ>Rosette
                  MC</ASTROBJ> displays clear signatures of
                  compressive forcing. <BR /> Conclusions: The strong
                  dependence of the density PDF on the type of forcing
                  must be taken into account in any theory using the
                  PDF to predict properties of star formation. We
                  supply a quantitative description of this
                  dependence. We find that different observed regions
                  show evidence of different mixtures of compressive
                  and solenoidal forcing, with more compressive
                  forcing occurring primarily in swept-up
                  shells. Finally, we emphasise the role of the sonic
                  scale for protostellar core formation, because core
                  formation close to the sonic scale would naturally
                  explain the observed subsonic velocity dispersions
                  of protostellar cores. <P />A movie is only

  abstract =	 {The scaling of velocity fluctuation deltav as a
                  function of spatial scale L in molecular clouds can
                  be measured from size-line width relations,
                  principal component analysis, or line centroid
                  variation. Differing values of the power-law index
                  of the scaling relation <deltav2>1/2~Lgamma3D in
                  three dimensions are given by these different
                  methods: the first two give gamma3D~=0.5, while line
                  centroid analysis gives gamma3D~=0. This discrepancy
                  has previously not been fully appreciated, as the
                  variation of projected velocity line centroid
                  fluctuations (<deltav2lc>1/2~Lgamma2D) is indeed
                  described, in two dimensions, by
                  gamma2D~0.5. However, if projection smoothing is
                  accounted for, this implies, in three dimensions,
                  that gamma3D~0. We suggest that a resolution of this
                  discrepancy can be achieved by accounting for the
                  effect of density inhomogeneity on the observed
                  gamma2D obtained from velocity line centroid
                  analysis. Numerical simulations of compressible
                  turbulence are used to show that the effect of
                  density inhomogeneity statistically, but not
                  identically, reverses the effect of projection
                  smoothing in the case of driven turbulence, so that
                  velocity line centroid analysis does indeed predict
                  that gamma2D~gamma3D~0.5. For decaying turbulence,
                  the effect of density inhomogeneity on the velocity
                  line centroids diminishes with time so that at late
                  times, gamma2D~gamma3D+0.5 as a result of projection
                  smoothing alone. Deprojecting the observed line
                  centroid statistics thus requires some knowledge of
                  the state of the flow. This information can be
                  inferred from the spectral slope of the column
                  density power spectrum and a measure of the standard
                  deviation in column density relative to the
                  mean. Using our numerical results, we can restore
                  consistency between line centroid analysis,
                  principal component analysis, and size-line width
                  relations, and we derive gamma3D~0.5, corresponding
                  to shock-dominated (Burgers) turbulence, which also
                  describes the simulations of driven turbulence at
                  scales on which numerical dissipation is
                  negligible. We find that this consistency requires
                  that molecular clouds are continually driven on
                  large scales or are only recently formed.},

                  velocity structure, and ultimately the birth of
                  stars<SUP>3-8</SUP>. Here we present a simulation of
                  interstellar turbulence with a grid resolution of
                  10,048<SUP>3</SUP> cells that allows us to determine
                  the position and width of the sonic scale
                  (ℓ<SUB>s</SUB>)—the transition from supersonic to
                  subsonic turbulence. The simulation simultaneously
                  resolves the supersonic and subsonic cascade, with
                  the velocity as a function of scale, v(ℓ) ∝
                  ℓ<SUP>p</SUP>, where we measure p<SUB>sup</SUB> =

                  respectively. We find that ℓ<SUB>s</SUB> agrees with

                  molecular cloud, and ϕ<SUB>s</SUB> is a
                  dimensionless factor of order unity. If L is the

                  because of the separation between the driving scale
                  and the start of the supersonic cascade. For a

                  measure (EM) fluctuations in the same field taken
                  from the Southern Hα Sky Survey Atlas. The structure
                  function of RM fluctuations shows a relatively steep
                  slope at small scales (1'-5'), a break in slope to a
                  flatter structure function at intermediate scales
                  (5'-60'), and a systematic variation of the strength
                  of fluctuations as a function of position angle on
                  the sky at the largest scales (60'-200'). The
                  structure function of EM fluctuations shows similar

                  prevents detection of a possible break in the
                  spectrum. We interpret the anisotropy in RM/EM
                  structure on large scales as resulting from a
                  large-scale gradient in electron density (and
                  possibly magnetic field) across the region. The
                  break in the slope of the RM structure function at
                  scales of ~5' can be explained by contributions from
                  two spatially distinct magnetoionized screens, most
                  likely in the Local and Carina spiral arms. The
                  observed structure function then implies that the
                  outer scale of RM fluctuations in these screens is
                  ~2 pc. Such behavior is in striking contrast to the
                  expectation that interstellar turbulence forms an
                  unbroken spectrum from kiloparsec down to AU
                  scales. We conclude that we have identified an
                  additional source of enhanced turbulence, injected
                  on scales of a few pc, possibly seen only in the

                  scale size is similar to the outer scale of
                  turbulence inferred here. These sources may be the

                  compared to numerical simulations. This picture
                  brings a robust support to star formation paradigms
                  where the mass concentration in turbulent
                  star-forming clouds evolves from initially large,
                  weakly correlated filamentary structures to smaller,
                  denser, more correlated ones, and eventually to
                  small, tightly correlated, prestellar cores. We
                  stress that the present results rely on a pure
                  statistical approach of density fluctuations and do
                  not involve any specific condition for the formation
                  of prestellar cores. Interestingly enough, we show
                  that, under average conditions typical of Milky-Way
                  molecular clouds, this invariant average mass is
                  about a solar mass, providing an appealing
                  explanation for the apparent universality of the IMF
                  in such environments.},

  abstract =	 {Observations of molecular clouds (MCs) show that
                  their properties exhibit large fluctuations. The
                  proper characterization of the general statistical
                  behavior of these fluctuations, from a limited
                  sample of observations or simulations, is of prime
                  importance to understand the process of star
                  formation. In this article, we use the ergodic
                  theory for any random field of fluctuations, as
                  commonly used in statistical physics, to derive
                  rigorous statistical results. We outline how to
                  evaluate the autocovariance function (ACF) and the
                  characteristic correlation length of these
                  fluctuations. We then apply this statistical
                  approach to astrophysical systems characterized by a
                  field of density fluctuations, notably star-forming
                  clouds. When it is difficult to determine the
                  correlation length from the empirical ACF, we show
                  alternative ways to estimate the correlation
                  length. Notably, we give a way to determine the
                  correlation length of density fluctuations from the
                  estimation of the variance of the volume and
                  column-density fields. We show that the statistics
                  of the column-density field is hampered by biases
                  introduced by integration effects along the line of
                  sight and we explain how to reduce these biases. The
                  statistics of the probability density function (PDF)
                  ergodic estimator also yields the derivation of the
                  proper statistical error bars. We provide a method
                  that can be used by observers and numerical
                  simulation specialists to determine the latter. We
                  show that they (i) cannot be derived from simple
                  Poisson statistics and (ii) become increasingly
                  large for increasing density contrasts, severely
                  hampering the accuracy of the high end part of the
                  PDF because of a sample size that is too small. As
                  templates of various stages of star formation in
                  MCs, we then examine the case of the Polaris and
                  Orion B clouds in detail. We calculate, from the
                  observations, the ACF and the correlation length in
                  these clouds and show that the latter is on the
                  order of ~1% of the size of the cloud. This
                  justifies the assumption of statistical homogeneity
                  when studying the PDF of star-forming clouds. These
                  calculations provide a rigorous framework for the
                  analysis of the global properties of star-forming
                  clouds from limited statistical observations of
                  their density and surface properties.},

  abstract =	 {We introduce and test an expression for calculating
                  the variance of a physical field in three dimensions
                  using only information contained in the
                  two-dimensional projection of the field. The method
                  is general but assumes statistical isotropy. To test
                  the method we apply it to numerical simulations of
                  hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in
                  molecular clouds, and demonstrate that it can
                  recover the three-dimensional (3D) normalized
                  density variance with ~10 per cent accuracy if the
                  assumption of isotropy is valid. We show that the
                  assumption of isotropy breaks down at low sonic Mach
                  number if the turbulence is
                  sub-Alfvénic. Theoretical predictions suggest that
                  the 3D density variance should increase
                  proportionally to the square of the Mach number of
                  the turbulence. Application of our method will allow
                  this prediction to be tested observationally and
                  therefore constrain a large body of analytic models
                  of star formation that rely on it.},

                  programme aiming to provide accurate independent
                  estimates of the Hubble constant (H$_{0}$) using the
                  L(H{$\beta$})-{$\sigma$} distance estimator for
                  giant extragalactic H II regions (GEHR) and H II
                  galaxies.  We have used Very Large Telescope and
                  Subaru high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of
                  a local sample of H II galaxies, identified in the
                  Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7)
                  catalogue in order to redefine and improve the
                  L(H{$\beta$})-{$\sigma$} distance indicator and to
                  determine the Hubble constant. To this end, we
                  utilized as local calibration or 'anchor' of this
                  correlation GEHR in nearby galaxies which have
                  accurate distance measurements determined via
                  primary indicators. Using our best sample of 69
                  nearby H II galaxies and 23 GEHR in nine galaxies,
                  we obtain H$_{0}$= 74.3 {\plusmn} 3.1 (statistical)
                  {\plusmn} 2.9 (systematic) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$,
                  in excellent agreement with, and independently
